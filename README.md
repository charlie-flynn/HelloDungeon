How to play!

When the game prompts you to make a decision, type in either the word (or words) or number assigned to the choice you wish to make.

Combat

There is combat! Magic attacks cost MANA, which is restored by doing Melee attacks! Both you or the enemy can land a critical hit, which deals massive damage!

Encounter over 2 enemies in the dungeon. Answer riddles given by a Molten Sphinx, or defeat a Mimic for an Enchanted Blade, no matter what you will forge your own path into the depths of the dungeon.
- Over zero items to find!
- Currency!
- There's actually over 3 enemies!
