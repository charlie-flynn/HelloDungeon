C# Coding Practice for AIE

Download the program by clicking [here,](https://github.com/charlie-flynn/HelloDungeon/releases) then clicking on the HelloDungeon_V1.0.zip file at the top of the Assets list to download it!

Now that the file is downloaded, go into your Downloads folder to find HelloDungeon_V1.0.zip. Right-click the file, then click "Extract All".

Afterwards, open the newly extracted folder, and double-click the file named HelloDungeon.exe to run the program!

I do highly recommend clicking on the file named README.txt, located in the same folder. It contains some useful information about the program that is a little more in-depth than this file!

How to play!

When the game prompts you to make a decision, type in either the word (or words) or number assigned to the choice you wish to make.

Combat

There is combat! Magic attacks cost MANA, which is restored by doing Melee attacks! Both you or the enemy can land a critical hit, which deals massive damage!

Encounter over 2 enemies in the dungeon. Answer riddles given by a Molten Sphinx, or defeat a Mimic for an Enchanted Blade, no matter what you will forge your own path into the depths of the dungeon.
- Over zero items to find!
- Currency!
- There's actually over 3 enemies!
